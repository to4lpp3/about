# Usage Guide

This is to show Sourcegraph Engineers how to use this repository.

## Why a Public Project Planning and Blog Post repository?

Each feature is important enough to warrant its own blog post or at least, its own page in the documentation.

Previously, the `private-docs` repo was for an internal audience, resulting in docs that often fell out of date and didn't reflect the final feature set. This made writing the blog post for a non-project member difficult and meant it had to be written towards the end of the iteration.

We're changing this so writing your project plan and writing a blog post about your project is now the same thing. This will be tough but has huge benefits:

 - Your blog post will now be developed at the start and during the development of the project.
 - As it's a blog post (not just an internal document), it needs to be written for an external audience which forces a higher quality of content.
 - We can gather feedback from passionate Sourcegraph users about our projects and their features during the development process, including the blog post content.
 - Disributing the load of blog post creation to project team members means more content for our developer audience and more engagement on our blog and social media.
 - You'll improve your writing and communication chops.

## For Projects

Copy the contents of the `TEMPLATE.md` and create a file in the `projects` directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-<project-title>.md` so we can order by date and group by iteration/target release date.

## For Blog Posts

Of course we still need regular blog posts so copy the contents of the `TEMPLATE.md` and create a file in the `blog` directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-<blog-title>.md`.
