# Usage Guide

## Why a Public Project Planning and Blog Post repository?

Each project is significant enough to deserve a dedicated blog post. Instead of doing this at the end of the iteration in a separate document, the project plan is now also the blog post about your project. Writing it may be tough but has enormous benefits:

 - As it's a blog post (not just an internal document), it has an external audience which forces a higher quality of content.
 - We can gather feedback from Sourcegraph users about our projects and their features during the development process, including the blog post content.
 - Distributing the responsibility of blog post creation to team members means more content for our developer audience and more engagement on our blog.
 - You'll improve your writing and communication chops.

## For Projects

Copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md` and create a file in the `projects` directory using the naming convention `project-title.md`.

## For Blog Posts

We still need regular blog posts so copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md` and create a file in the `blog` directory using the naming convention `blog-title.md`.
