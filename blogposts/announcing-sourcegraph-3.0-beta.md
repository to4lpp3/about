**Update:** [Sourcegraph 3.0 is now released.](/blog/announcing-sourcegraph-3.0) Beta instances should update now. We've removed the 3.0 beta announcement text here to avoid confusion, but you can view the [original 3.0 beta announcement](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about@2d7aec18655aacfee43fb8ec7c613b45c0a80797/-/blob/blogposts/announcing-sourcegraph-3.0-beta.md) if needed.
