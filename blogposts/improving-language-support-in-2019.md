TODO introductory sentence about committing to code intelligence (make this grab your attention). This directly aligns with our [Sourcegraph master plan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/plan) of bringing basic code intelligence to every devloper wherever you see code.

These principles will guide future improvements:

- Prioritize languages by a combination of popularity and ease of analysis
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Fund improvements to language servers it means language support will improve faster
- UI/UX ergonomics matter

Sourcegraph believes that there will be one canonical language server per language, and we will be investing effort in what's likely to succeed and become adopted by the respective language community.

We will test language servers based on:

- Basic features such as hover tooltips, jump-to-definition, and find-references in simple and popular repositories
- Initialization time and response time
- Cross-repository code intelligence

If you're interested in language analysis and want to add language support to Sourcegraph, we want to hear from you! Tweet at @srcgraph. Sourcegraph is willing to sponsor work on language servers and Sourcegraph language extensions, provide technical advice, and gather feedback.
