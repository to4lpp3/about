# Sourcegraph values

Our values are:

## People

Together we are advancing technology for the good of people all around the world. We will attract, hire and retain the best teammates in the world and treat everyone in a first-class manner.

## Journey

The collection of moments, experiences, and memories that the team shares as we make progress: the light moments, the laughter, the team coming together to solve a problem.

## Progress

The continuous march toward achieving our mission as a team: the milestones, the successes, and the breakthroughs.

## Just Workplace

- We strive to work against and avoid reproducing systemic injustices. 
- We're grateful and not defensive when people point out our failings here.
- All teammates are empowered to create an accessible and inclusive work environment, and encouraged to spend their work hours doing so whenever they see an opportunity.
- Some examples of what this has looked like in practice:
  - Juneteenth is a paid holiday to take anti-racist actions.
  - Updating the team page and e-mail signatures to include pronouns.
  - Enabling a slack bot to help teammates learn about uninclusive or discriminatory language.
