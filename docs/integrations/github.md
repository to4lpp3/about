The Sourcegraph browser extension will add **go-to-definition**, **find-references**, **hover tooltips**, and **code search** to all GitHub files and Pull Requests.

By default, the extension will add code intelligence and code search to public repositories. The extension can be configured to work on private code by connecting it to a Sourcegraph instance that has [code intelligence](/docs/code-intelligence).

1.  Install the Sourcegraph browser extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sourcegraph/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sourcegraph/)
2.  Click the extension icon to connect the browser extension to your Sourcegraph instance. Then, fill in the Sourcegraph URL field with your Sourcegraph URL and hit save.

3.  [Update Sourcegraph site configuration](/docs/config/) to allow the extension to communicate with your Sourcegraph instance:

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "corsOrigin": "https://github.com"
      // ...
    }
    ```

You're done! You'll now get **code intelligence** and **code search** on GitHub for all private repositories that you've added to Sourcegraph.
