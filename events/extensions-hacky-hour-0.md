# Sourcegraph extensions hacky hour[0]

Come to the Sourcegraph extensions hacky hour Friday December 15 from 3:00pm-5:00pm to hack on an extension.

Sourcegraph extensions enable you to extend code hosts and Sourcegraph itself by adding features such as:

- Code intelligence (go-to-definition, find references, hovers, etc.)
- Test coverage overlays
- Links to live traces, log output, and performance data for a line of code
- Custom search providers, e.g. GitHub issues and comments

## What to build

The best way to think about what to build is:

> If you could change GitHub's code view and PR pages, what features would you add? What would make your life better as a developer?
