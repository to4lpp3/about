# Customer Support

Customer Support at Sourcegraph exists to resolve technical issues and answer technical/product questions in a way that feels (reasonably) effortless for our customers. Support is the go-to technical team for the Customer Engineering team, helping customers both pre- and post-sales.

We show up for our customers, open source users, and teammates by living up to our Sourcegraph values and handbook, as well as these additional guiding principles …

- Seeking/providing context so the why is clear
- Demonstrating profound compassion for the people with whom our paths cross and the problems/questions we help them solve, meeting them where they are
- Only asking our customers and teammates things we can’t do or answer ourselves
- Persistently working toward and/or seeking resolution that works equally for our customers and us
- Staying at least a step ahead (summarizing current status, giving clear next steps, and setting expectations in every communication)
- Being flexible and open, maintaining a first principles thinking approach, and always confronting and growing past our biases
- Outgrowing ourselves, the way we work, and continuously improving

Keeping our reason for existence and guiding principles in mind in all of our work and interactions, we ensure consistent outcomes, allowing each member of the team to have space and creativity to get there in different ways and learn from each other. When it is important that we do things consistently, we make sure to maintain our support section of the handbook. When we have knowledge to share, we ensure it’s reflected in [our official documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/) so that customers have a single source of truth.

Support (as a discipline) has a (sadly) deserved reputation. It is far too often an undervalued and/or mistreated function. It is also one of the few functions that sits as a nexus in the company. Most dysfunctions and bad business decisions impact a support team more acutely than other teams. It can be very hard to avoid burnout. And so, support is often viewed as a stepping stone only. It doesn’t have to be this way and it absolutely will not be this way for us. From the start, we will define our practices to make Customer Support at Sourcegraph a career destination like any other function -- this doesn’t mean that folks won’t come and go, they will depending on how their plans and ambitions change and that is okay. What matters is that no one is desperate to “get out.” Defining our practices clearly (and in a very specific way) is foundational to achieving this outcome.

There is loads of research ([thoughtfully animated here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&feature=youtu.be)) that explains that for a cognitive worker, motivation is usually tied to having autonomy, [expertise], and purpose. I posit that autonomy is only truly possible if you have alignment and ability (which are continuously reinforced), and that expertise and purpose are just aspects of ability and alignment, respectively.
