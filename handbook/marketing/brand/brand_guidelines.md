# Brand Guidelines

>All notes in ***italized bold text*** 

Our brand is at the root of everything we do. It’s how we behave, communicate, look, and interact, across digital and real-world touch-points. Each element of our brand works together to demonstrate who we are and what we believe in. We express our brand through our brand story, brand voice, and brand visuals. 

Everything defined in our brand guide — from typeface, to color, to texture — is carefully chosen to visually represent our brand.

## Primary Typefaces

Our primary company typeface is Source Sans. Our typefaces work cohesively to clearly present data in a modern, accessible, open, and informative way, that aligns with our brand voice and values. The Source type family is Adobe’s first open source typeface, designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is intended to be extremely legible in both print and digital uses.    

The Source type family was selected for three primary reasons:    
1. Because it is fully open source and this aligns with our values as a company;    
1. It provides a sans serif and a code typeface that is useful for showing code snippets on marketing web pages;   
1. It refers back to the name of our own company — a perfect match.
