# Demand Generation
The Demand Generation at Sourcegraph is focused on building engagement with our end users and customers. We exist to share the value of Sourcegraph, create interest in our products, and support a healthy pipeline for sales. We do this by partnering with marketing and sales to develop campaigns, activation strategies, and measurement plans to ensure we’re presenting the most valuable information to the right audience at the right time with demonstrable results.
  
## Our Strategy

> Be Delightful

<p>Developers are a fiercely loyal audience. Creating affinity and trust is the hardest part for a dev-focused business so that’s the part we’re going to focus on. We firmly believe that focusing our efforts on delighting the people who interact with us will result in the highest long term yields as a business. </p>
