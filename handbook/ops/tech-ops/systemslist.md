Bamboo HR

Bamboo is a system of record for Sourcegraph’s internal team and HR information. It is the place to go to find a team directory, org chart, view information about your direct reports, request time off, and more. The [team page in the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/team) will remain in place, but it will now be an informal list (while Bamboo is the official one).
