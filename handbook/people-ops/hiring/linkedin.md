## How to get a hiring manager seat assigned

2. Message @david or david@sourcegraph.com to assign you a hiring manager seat. Please include details of which role your are hiring for and set up time to create a search string for the role.

## Hiring manager seat capabilities
1. Viewing and reviewing candidates in a project you are added to. 
2. Viewing candidates that applied or are apply starters (LinkedIn's term for candidates that clicked the apply button, but may not have actually applied).

## Search filters 
Work with the recruiter to create search criterias for your role. This will be used to generate an automated pipeline of outbound candidates for the hiring manager to review.
