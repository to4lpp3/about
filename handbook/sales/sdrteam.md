# SDR - AE Handoff for Inbound/Outbound Prospect Follow-up Guidelines:

Before the call with the Prospect:

- Once the SDR sets the initial meeting (i.e., a calendar invite has been sent out by the SDR to the prospect and AE).
- SDR sends a summary of opp to AE, and gets confirmation on proposed Agenda and any additional attendees to be included from Sourcegraph (CE, Manager, etc.).
- SDR sends a follow-up email to the Prospect to:
  - Introduce the AE (& anyone else) that is joining the call.
  - Provide a proposed agenda (pricing, use case, quick tour, etc.), that is confirmed first by the AE.
  - Encourage the Prospect to provide more context as it relates to their interest and feedback on the proposed agenda.
  - Provide value by including any relevant case studies, docs, 1-pager, etc.
  - End the note with excitement, "we look forward to speaking with you soon!"

On the actual call with the Prospect:

- SDR starts the call, sets the tone by giving a quick overview on how the SDR and the Prospect got connected, and then transition to something like "I've caught (AE/CE) up to speed on our conversation, I'll go ahead and pass the mic to Bill/Kai to introduce themselves."
- AE jumps in, introduces themselves and CE (if there is), and takes the call from there.

At the end of the call:

- AE wraps up the call, confirm, next steps.
  - Note: if towards the end of the call, the AE can't solidify next steps, with the SDRs best judgment, the SDR may step in as *"second voice"* and attempt to pencil down next steps, only if it makes sense.

After the call:

- AE will then follow-up via email cc'ing the SDR and CE.
  - Note: SDRs don't need to be cc'ed on all prospect emails, just the initial ones.
- At this point, **the handoff to AE is now complete.**

The purpose of this framework is to encourage a much more fluid introduction and transition from SDR to AE; this isn't meant to be a strict and rigid process but rather a guide.

Sending the initial email opens the communication line for all parties instead of having the proposed agenda in the calendar invite.

This helps with building a continuous rapport between the Prospect, and SDRs. In the event the Prospect becomes unresponsive, SDRs can step in and attempt to re-ignite the conversation again, or perhaps the Prospect has a question, they can reach out to the SDR (Handy is a perfect recent example of this)

Finally, this is just a proactive way to ensure SDRs are setting high-quality meetings for their AEs.
