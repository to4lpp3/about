# Content Creation Guide

Writing content can seem daunting but don't wait for inspiration to strike. Just start, using the below as a guide and improve as you go.

## Choose a topic and write a headline

What the feature does is a starting point but can you go deeper? What's the point? What do you want them to do or feel or experience? What's the impact it will have?

## Write the lead paragraph

This is the hardest but most important paragraph as it sets the stage for the rest of your content. It's the equivalent of a cool hook at the beginning of a song. Try to capture their interest to get them continue reading.

## Define a rough structure

List a few main points in the body to give your post some structure. It's easier to do this first, then expand. Don't worry about getting your structure perfect, just get something down.

## Edit and revise

No one writes perfect content the first time around. Get it down, give it some space, then revisit. Be kind to yourself and accept that quality content, just like quality code often takes time and refactoring (editing) to get it where it needs to be.

## Proofread

Now that you're happy with the content, focus now on the structure, grammer and flow of your content.

Once you're happy with it, get a colleague to read it and address their feedback if any.

## Ready for final copy editing

Woo! Great stuff, now we bring in a professional Copy Editor.

Create an issue using the `Copy Editing Request` issue template.
