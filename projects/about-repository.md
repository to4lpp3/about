# Open product, open company

As part of open sourcing the core of Sourcegraph, we are also building and planning Sourcegraph in the open.

Open product: you might not realize it, but the products you use everyday are not only open source, but also open products. Products like Kubernetes and VSCode do all their product planning in the open, and encourage input from the community.

Open company: for commercial products, being open product isn't enough to gain trust. The default for internal company processes, not just product and engineering, should be open. You can find repositories that contain infromation about our marketing, hiring etc. This is important because with open source, customers know we still have a business. We want to be super transparent about how we make money and stay as a business.

Open company doesn't mean that all the implementation details of our company are public, but the way we develop and operate our business is public.

We've made the sourcegraph/about open, which is our current and future product roadmap. Our website, internal and external documentation, and blog posts are available.

Product roadmap:
 - Lets customers and users know what's coming up.
 - Lets customers and followers keep us accountable to and give feedback on our roadmap.
 - Powerful internal communication tool that allows engineers own shipping products end to end and focus on the user.
 - Demonstrates efficiency: a single document is used for product planning and our release announcement.
 - Amazon does this internally: they pre-write the press release for anything they ship.

Our blog content is also open and available. You can also see work in progress blog posts before they're published.

Process:
 - We kick off projects with the project document in this repo.
 - Our designer, dev rel, and CEO sit together in a room to draft out a blog post. This blog post itself is going through this process at this very moment.
 - Then, we go share this with customers, users, and anyone who can provide feedback to ensure we're on the right track.
 - The developers make GitHub issues and post a GitHub issues link to the project document.
 - The project team then makes this document true. They know exactly what they're building from day one, and won't have any surprise additions appear while building. When it's ready, they flip the switch and publish the post. There's no last minute rush to create a blog post that attempts to describe what was built.


Implementation notes
 - We only have 3 or 4 pages on the site in HTML. Everything else is in Markdown, so everyone can easily read and contribute to our documents.
