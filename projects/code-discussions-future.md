This living document describes the future direction of Sourcegraph's [code discussions](code-discussions.md) feature.

The future of code discussions will be 100% based on your feedback. You have the ability to be a direct influence over the feature and how it develops.

We want to hear from YOU!

## Providing feedback

Use code discussions to give us feedback:

1. [View this document on Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/blob/projects/code-discussions-future.md#tab=discussions)
2. Click the **Raw** view button, and select any line to create a new discussion.

We're really excited about improving how developers discuss code. But we need your help to do it. If you have any ideas, thoughts, feedback, concerns, etc. please let us know!
