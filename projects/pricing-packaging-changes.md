Earlier this month, we made most of Sourcegraph [open source](/blog/sourcegraph-is-now-open-source). As a part of this, more of Sourcegraph’s advanced features will be available to you for free, and one feature needed by larger companies is becoming paid. These changes will make it easier for teams to get started and get the full power of Sourcegraph right away.

Putting this into practice, here’s what’s becoming free:

- Code intelligence for all supported languages
- Hybrid search (scalable to 10s of thousands of repositories)

And here’s what’s becoming paid:

- Single sign-on (SSO) integrations

Find full details on our [pricing page](/pricing).

As always, it’s [free to use](https://docs.sourcegraph.com) Sourcegraph for your team. To purchase a license to use SSO, we now provide self-service checkout right on Sourcegraph.com. Visit (https://sourcegraph.com/user/subscriptions/new) to buy a license today.
