# Pricing and package changes

Today we are excited to announce that most of Sourcegraph will be [open sourced](link to oss blog post). As a part of this, more of Sourcegraph’s advanced features will be available to you for free, and one feature needed by larger companies is becoming paid. Our philosophy is to charge for features that large companies need to use Sourcegraph at scale, and to leave everything else free.

Putting this into practice, here’s what’s becoming free:

- Code intelligence for all supported languages
- Hybrid search (scalable to 10s of thousands of repositories)

And here’s what’s becoming paid:

- Single sign-on (SSO) integrations

Find full details on our [pricing page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing).

As always, it’s [free to use](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs) Sourcegraph for your team. To purchase a license to use SSO, we now provide self-service checkout right on Sourcegraph.com. Visit (https://sourcegraph.com/ROUTE_FOR_BUYING) to buy a license today.

Existing customer with questions about these changes? [Contact us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact) if with any questions.
