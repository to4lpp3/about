# Pricing and package changes

Today we are excited to announce that most of Sourcegraph will be [open sourced](link to oss blog post). As a part of this, more of Sourcegraph’s advanced features will be available to you for free, and one feature needed by larger companies is becoming paid. These changes will make it easier for teams to get started and get the full power of Sourcegraph right away.

## What’s becoming free:

- Code intelligence for all supported languages
- Hybrid search (scalable to 10s of thousands of repositories)

## What’s becoming paid:

- Single sign-on (SSO) integrations

Find full details on our [pricing page.](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing).

As always, it’s [free to use](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs) Sourcegraph for your team. To purchase a license to use SSO, we now provide self-service checkout right on Sourcegraph.com. Visit (https://sourcegraph.com/ROUTE_FOR_BUYING) to buy a license today. 

Existing customer with questions about these changes? [Contact us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact) if with any questions.
